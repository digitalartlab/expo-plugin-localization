## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the [Security page on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalartlab/expo-plugin-localization/security). This will create a private issue in the repository, which only the maintainers can see. The maintainers will then respond to the issue as soon as possible.
